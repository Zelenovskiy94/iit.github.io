                <i>(Pursuant to Board of Trustees Action No. 2018-50, dated March 24, 2018)</i><br>
                <br>
                <p class="paragraph_large_X"><strong>I. Introduction</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>These guidelines are promulgated by Intellisense Institute of Technology in accordance with the Data Privacy Act (DPA) of 2012 otherwise known as Republic Act (RA) 10173. This law aims to “protect the fundamental human right of privacy and of communication while ensuring free flow of information to promote innovation and growth.”</p>
                <p>The DPA is concerned with the protection of <i>“personal data”</i> or <i>“personal information”</i> - a type of data or information, which by themselves or collectively, can distinctly identify an individual. Personal information, as used in these guidelines, refer to such things as one’s name, age, address, sex, race, religious or philosophical affiliation, contact information, among others. Personal information, at the hands of the wrong people, may endanger the rights of the person to whom they refer to. It is for this reason that the DPA was enacted by Congress and these guidelines are promulgated by the School.</p>
                <p>The School is aware that because of its nature as an institution, it is one where a lot of information is collected, generated, stored, transferred, or otherwise processed. The School respects the privacy rights of all persons with whom it comes into contact while being true to its mission as a Christian higher education institution committed to achieving academic excellence. In line with the mandate of the National Privacy Commission, the government agency tasked to implement the DPA, Intellisense Institute of Technology is committed to achieving the twin purposes of the law to safeguard privacy rights as well as allowing for the meaningful and productive exchange of information.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="paragraph_large_X"><strong>II. Coverage</strong></p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>These guidelines shall apply to all departments, colleges, schools, institutes, offices, and units of Intellisense Institute of Technology with reference to its students at all levels.</li>
                        <li>The Human Resource and Development Office, Office of the General Counsel, Management Information System, Business and Administration Office, Office of the Registrar, Alumni Affairs Office, and Office of Students Services, shall have separate privacy guidelines that are tailored to the specific functions of such offices in relation to their respective data subjects. In cases where the interests of a student overlaps with the function of those offices, their guidelines shall have supplemental application to these guidelines.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="paragraph_large_X"><strong>III. Purposes for Processing Information</strong></p>

                <p class="paragraph_large_X"><strong>IV. Personal Information Processed</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>Personal information gathered, generated, recorded, received, or used by the School takes on many forms, including written records, photographs, videos, sound recordings, and other electronic forms. These vary according to the type of information processed, the purpose for which it is gathered, and the length of time required for their purpose. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Personal Information Collected During Admissions Process</strong><br>
                            Upon application for enrolment by a new or continuing student, we collect a variety of information including, but not exclusive to: name, age, citizenship, residence of origin, religious affiliation, phone number, e-mail address, and other contact details. The School also collects previous school records, medical records, and other personal circumstances. This is done online through the online enrolment mechanism available on the Intellisense Institute of Technology website (https://su.edu.ph) or when the student fills up the enrolment form that is submitted to the admissions office.</li>
                        <li><strong>Personal Information Collected or Generated While in Intellisense Institute of Technology</strong><br>
                            In the course of a student’s stay in Intellisense Institute of Technology, additional information is collected or generated by the appropriate units of the School, including the following:
                            <br>a. Academic performance information, e.g. attendance records, scores, grades;
                            <br>b. CCTV recordings and photographs by security cameras in the campuses and premises of the School;
                            <br>c. Disciplinary records and/or involvement in incidents;
                            <br>d. Membership in student organizations;
                            <br>e. Details of co-curricular activities, e.g. internship, on-the-job trainings, apprenticeships, service-learning, and other
                            School-sanctioned extension services;
                            <br>f. Attendance in outreach activities, seminars, workshops, or lectures;
                            <br>g. Details provided during application for permits.</li>
                            <li><strong>Personal Information Volunteered by Third Parties</strong><br>
                            Information about students given to the School by third parties are retained and used if they are relevant to the educational purpose, the welfare of the student, and other legitimate and interests of the School. If not, they will be disposed in a manner that will protect the privacy of the student concerned. For example, in case of an accident, a student’s emergency contact person may provide information not previously available to the School, but would be helpful during the treatment of the student.
                            This section also covers information regarding one student volunteered by a fellow student.   </li>

                <br>
                <p class="paragraph_large_X"><strong>V. Storage of Information</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>Personal information is stored in various databases, media, and forms. Even as the School continues with its project to digitize its databases through the Management Information System, personal data is also stored in paper forms across different units and offices. Duplication is not unusual as several offices may store the same or similar sets of information for purposes of coordination. The permanence of these databases also vary across offices depending on their functions. For example, transcripts of records are permanent records. As such, the School will retain them for as long as law requires. Meanwhile, information that is only temporarily needed will be disposed of as soon as their temporary purpose has expired.</p><br>
                <p>All units of the School which stores or handles personal information are required to implement physical, technical, and organizational security measures to ensure the safe storage of personal information and to ensure that such is used only by authorized personnel for legitimate purposes.</p>

                <br>
                <p> The School is committed to observing the limits of law in the sharing, disclosure, and transfer of students’ personal data among its offices as well as to third party organizations or persons. In general, sharing of personal information is limited to educational, administrative, research, and statistical purposes. Instances when sharing of information is done include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
